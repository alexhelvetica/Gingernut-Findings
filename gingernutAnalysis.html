      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>
        To answer the nation’s most important questions, {insert bullshit here},
        I used various Coles API’s to retrieve the inventory status for various
        Arnott's biscuit for each Coles in Australia. This data isn’t
        necessarily representative of the stock available in each store, but
        what is available to be ordered through Coles Online.
      </p>

      <p>
        For each store, I have classified each item as “In Stock”, “Out of
        Stock” or “Not Stocked”. If it is either of the former 2, I have opted
        that that store sells it.
      </p>
      <p>

      <h1>Arnott's Gingernut</h1>
      <p>
        As Gingernut biscuits lovers have unfortunately discovered when
        travelling interstate, Arnott's has multiple gingernut recipes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When various biscuit manufacturers across Australia were swallowed up
        into Arnott's in the 1960's, Arnott's decided to standardise to their
        own recipe, the NSW one. As everyone outside of NSW (and ACT) rightfully
        realised at the time, that variety is kinda shit to what they’re used
        to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arnott's had to cave, in these days, companies didn’t just make a
        product worse and get away with it. In fact, the word “Enshittification”
        hadn’t even been invented yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, all 4 Gingernut biscuits are made in their factory in
        Virginia Queensland.
      </p>

      <h2>Strange Oddities?</h2>
      <h2>Victoria</h2>
      <p>
        Caroline Springs apparently sells the Victorian, and the South
        Australian SKUs. I assume this is bad data, but maybe Coles DC got sent
        a pallet of SA stuff by mistake?
      </p>
      <p>
        Only 1 of 2 Mildura's stores sell Gingernuts, and the Eighth Street
        store sells the SA SKU. Traitor, but I guess it makes sense.
      </p>
      <h2>New South Wales</h2>
      <p>
        Scomo's store (Engadine) and Nano Raptor's store (Bathurst) apparently
        sell the Victorian and Cockroaches* varieties. I guess probably bad
        data, but who knows.
      </p>
      <p class="smallCorrection">
        * I asked XSS what they're called. I don't get it, but sure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Northern NSW sells the Queensland SKUs. Kempsey and Port Macquarie are
        right in the middle of both clusters and sell both. That seems fairly
        plausable.
      </p>
      <p>Similarly, Broken Hill sells both the NSW and SA biscuits.</p>
      <h2>Mystery State</h2>
      <p>
        Coles #7511 apparently sells the Victorian and NSW SKU. I don't exactly
        know what stores = [1234, 7511, 7512, 7513, 7514, 7515, 7517] are, but
        we could query them, and they returned "In Stock" or "Out of Stock" for
        some items.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think they are test stores, or virtual stores that exist for hacky
        Coles Online reasons. I know "0482CE1234" is the locationId for the Bob
        Maguire Foundation (482 is "Coles Online Hub" in Richmond), so 1234
        could be a "store" for an order sent to an external party?
      </p>
      <h1>Savoy and Jatz?!?!</h1>
      <p>
        Savoys were originally made by Brockhoff biscuit Company, back in the
        1930s. When Arnott's ate up Brockhoff in the 1960’s, they decided to
        keep Savoy as it was dominate in Victoria and Tasmania. Arnott's kept
        selling their Jatz in the other states.
      </p>

      <p>
        Savoy and Jatz are different biscuits. Savoy contains Golden Syrup, and
        Jatz contains Citric Acid. The ratios of the other ingredients will
        naturally also vary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Arnott's in 2019 incorrectly stated on Twitter that Jatz contains Milk
        Powder, and Savoy does not contain malt. Neither of these are the case;
        both offerings are Vegan, and both contain malt. I think the latter was
        said because, "It has has Golden Syrup, so it has slightly less sugar
        because we added a different form of sugar" doesn't sound as nice.
      </p>

      <h2>Interesting Findings?</h2>
      <p>
        Both stores in Albury (NSW) as well as Deniliquin (NSW) stock savoys
        over Jatz. Proving that a particular someone has always been a Savoy
        girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no stores that sells both Savoy and Jatz*. This is true of the
        Original, Cracked Pepper and Gluten Free Original varieties.
      </p>
      <p class="smallCorrection">
        * The single serve "snack packs" with cheese or/meat are only available
        with Jatz. Those are sold in all states.
